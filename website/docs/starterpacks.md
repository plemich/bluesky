# 🚀 Starter Packs

Starter packs in Bluesky are curated collections of folks to follow. These packs are created by the community and are a great way to get started with Bluesky. You can bulk follow the folks in the pack by clicking on the "Follow all" button on the starter pack page.

Starter packs are a great way for those getting started with Bluesky but you can also bookmark this page and come back to follow new packs and re-follow new folks added to the starter pack.

Feel free to create your own starter pack and submit a pull request to add it to this list by clicking on the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of this page.
